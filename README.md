# Family Tree Home Page
Make your family tree appear on the front page for all site users.

This is a custom module for [webtrees v2.0](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees).

Whenever someone visits your front page or signs in from the front page, they should land back on the front page again instead of seeing "My Page".

After installing this module, the "tree page" becomes the new "home page".  The personalized "my page" remains available, but only from the menus.

## Installation
1. Unzip the module files to `/var/www/webtrees/modules_v4/family-tree-home/` or equivalent.
1. Go test out your front page (root path) as well as the login page.

## To Disable
The preferred way to switch off the module is to rename `modules_v4/family-tree-home/` to `modules_v4/family-tree-home.disable/`

## To Uninstall
It is safe to delete the `family-tree-home` directory at any time.
